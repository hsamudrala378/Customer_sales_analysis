# Customer Sales Analysis with Python, SQLite, and Power BI

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow where Python is used to clean and process data, SQLite is used as a database to store processed results, and Power BI is used to create interactive dashboards for visualizing customer sales data.

## Steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Raw sales data is loaded into the project from the provided dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Python scripts clean the data, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and calculating metrics such as Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM).
3. **Data Analysis**: RFM analysis is performed to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.
4. **Data Visualization**: Insights from the data analysis are visualized using Power BI, creating an interactive dashboard.

## Files:
- **data/**: Contains raw and processed data files.
- **notebooks/**: Python scripts for data cleaning and analysis and SQL queries for extracting and transforming data from the SQLite database.
- **powerbi/**: Power BI files for data visualization.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- SQLite
- Power BI

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required Python libraries (if applicable).
3. Open the Power BI file to view the dashboards.
